              Hello! Welcome to my website! I'm Edwin, it's nice to e-meet you!
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always been drawn to tech and curious about how things are
              built. Especially tech since we would also run into various
              computer problems with that PC everyone shared growing up. Today,
              I continuously seek for new opportunities to learn and sharpen the
              tools I have to build new things.

                  I started my post secondary education studying life sciences
                  at McMaster University located in Hamilton, ON. In effort to
                  become more involve with tech, I chose to switch from Life
                  Sciences to Engineering after my first year of university.

                  After switching programs, I noticed that my courses are more
                  aligned with my interests and that this is something I wish to
                  pursue as a career. Today, I am a third year Software
                  Engineering and Management Student aspiring to be a future
                  Software Engineer and Product Manager.

                  As a tech enthusiast, I enjoy reading about new upcoming tech
                  and watching the latest tech reviews. I also enjoy reading the
                  TLDR newsletter which I highly recommend. You can subscribe to
                  it here: https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/

                  I believe very strongly about a good work-life balance. In my
                  free time, I try to find activities away from my workspace
                  such as cooking or going out for a nature walk. Occasionally I
                  would also watch some TV shows and some of my favourites
                  include Friends, The IT Crowd and The Boys.

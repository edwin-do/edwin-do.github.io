                  During this coop term, I proactively develop scripts to
                  automate the process of integrating business data from various
                  sources, using Selenium, Excel and Python, saving 30mins
                  daily. Utilizing the ServiceNow API, I also implemented
                  automated email reports to display weekly new incidents for
                  different applications.

                  During this coop term, I tracked and provided weekly analysis
                  on Senior Directorâ€™s resource allocation and SOW with external
                  vendors using Excel and MIS. I also executed automation test
                  scripts on the QA team using JavaScript, Protractor and
                  Selenium and developed python scripts to help extract data
                  from XML files in cash applications.

                  As part of my work-study throughout my fall semester, I worked
                  at the registrar office of McMaster. I provided technical
                  assistance and helped maintain the database collections. Wrote
                  a python script that achieved a 90% efficiency increase when
                  processing incoming students.

                  In the Summer of 2019, I developed exciting projects for high
                  school students enrolled in the computer science stream at
                  LEAP Academy. LEAP Academy is a program offered to high school
                  students to help them expore and discover their interest in
                  STEM. Through my projects and tutorials, I managed to improve
                  student engagement by 70% according to the term-end survey

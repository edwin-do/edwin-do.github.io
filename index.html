                          Hello! Welcome to my website! I'm <b>Edwin</b>, it's nice to e-meet you!
                          <br><br>
                          I have always been drawn to <b>tech</b> and curious about how things are built. 
                          We had one shared PC growing up in my family. 
                          When I was first introduced to emails and online messaging, it felt like <b>magic</b>. 
                          It drew me in, making me question things and wanting to learn more.
                          Today, as new technology is being developed and showcased at a much faster rate, I still find myself feeling excited and inspired. 
                          <br><br>
                          Throughout the years, I have worked with a wide variety of frameworks and tools which has helped me quickly learn and adapt to new technology.
                          Outside of programming, I love escape rooms, travelling, and thinking that I'm a great photographer when I take pictures of the food I eat.

                                            This was my first startup experience. We had a small but close development team, and communicated majority of our daily updates through standup. 
                                            I was onboarded through a in-house CLI tool that was used to pull and spin up all the required Docker images. 
                                            I started my term with a couple light tickets such as adding skeleton loaders, updating outdated packages and adding simple components in Vue.js.
                                            Afterwards, I quickly moved on to other new features such as pulling and displaying git information for a repository page,
                                            creating a file tree interface where users can navigate, add and delete files and folders, and implementing a tool bar used to zoom within the interface. 
                                            
                                          <span class="dots">...</span>
                                          <br><br>

                                          <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                                            In the later half of my term, I was tasked to create a Desktop application that can be installed on Windows and Linux machines. 
                                            I started out by researching the available options and compiled a table that compares the strengths and weaknesses between each option. 
                                            The team selected a couple potential candidates, and I quickly created a mock-up for each to see its compatability and identify any early problems.
                                            After presenting my findings to the team, we decided to move forward with Tauri and I started developing the application. 
                                            This application needed to communicate with sockets (linux) or named pipes (windows) using interprocess communication to determine the state of certain visual components.
                                            For example, if a connection is established, a status icon will be toggled green to reflect its state. 
                                            During my testing with this application, I ran into issues arised from a race condition when refreshing the statuses of multiple networks.
                                            I was able to solve this concurrency issue by using locks and some help from a senior developer. 
                                            I definitely learned a lot during this internship and would love to give everyone at MenloLab a shoutout for helping me along the way.

                                            I worked on the Product Development team and had the opportunity to work on an upcoming feature release. 
                                            My mentor (FreshBuddy) quickly helped me get onboarded and I started off familarizing myself with the services by tackling production bugs.
                                            Once I felt more comfortable in the codebase, I became more involved with the ongoing feature release and participated in more design related conversations.
                                            <br><br>
                                            My main responsiblilities during this internship were to implement new REST API endpoints and improve the error handling in various microservices.
                                            Through this, I was able to learn a lot about hexagonal architecture and how to write cleaner, easier to understand code through the feedback in my PRs and mentor. 
                                            I was also able to help provide feedback for the PRs on my team and engage in meaningful conversations. 
                                            All in all, I had a fantastic internship through my time at FreshBooks and I owe it all to my FreshBuddy and the team for being an absolute blast to be around.

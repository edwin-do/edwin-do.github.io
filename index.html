                          <br><br>
                          I have always been drawn to <b>tech</b> and curious about how things are built. 
                          We had one shared PC growing up in my family. 
                          When I was first introduced to emails and online messaging, it felt like <b>magic</b>. 
                          It drew me in, making me question things and wanting to learn more.
                          Today, as new technology is being developed and showcased at a much faster rate, I still find myself feeling excited and inspired. 
                          <br><br>
                          Throughout the years, I have worked with a wide variety of frameworks and tools which has helped me quickly learn and adapt to new technology.
                          Outside of programming, I love escape rooms, <b>travelling</b>, and thinking that I'm a great photographer when I take pictures of the food I eat.
                          <b>Keep scrolling</b> to learn more about my professional and personal experiences!

                    I worked on the Product Development team and had the opportunity to work on an upcoming feature release. 
                    My mentor (FreshBuddy) quickly helped me

                    get onboarded and I started off familarizing myself with the services by tackling production bugs.
                    Once I felt more comfortable in the codebase, I became more involved with the ongoing feature release and participated in more design related conversations.
                    
                    <br><br>    
                    My main responsiblilities during this internship were to implement new REST API endpoints and improve the error handling in various microservices.
                    Through this, I was able to learn a lot about hexagonal architecture and how to write cleaner, easier to understand code through the feedback in my PRs and mentor. 
                    I was also able to help provide feedback for the PRs on my team and engage in meaningful conversations. 
                    All in all, I had a fantastic internship through my time at FreshBooks and I owe it all to my FreshBuddy and the team for being an absolute blast to be around.

                  <p class="description text-left">
                    My first startup experience. We had a small but close development team, and communicated majority of our daily updates through standup. 
                    I started my term with a couple light tickets such as adding skeleton loaders, updating outdated packages and adding simple components in Vue.js
                    
                  <span class="dots">...</span>
                  <br><br>

                  <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                    Afterwards, I quickly moved on to other new features such as pulling and displaying git information for a repository page,
                    creating a file tree interface where users can navigate, add and delete files and folders, and implementing a tool bar used to zoom within the interface. 

                    <br><br>
                    In the later half of my term, I was tasked to create a Desktop application that can be installed on Windows and Linux machines. 
                    I started out by researching the available options and compiled a table that compares the strengths and weaknesses between each option. 
                    The team selected a couple potential candidates, and I quickly created a mock-up for each to see its compatability and identify any early problems.
                    After presenting my findings to the team, we decided to move forward with Tauri and I started developing the application. 
                    This application needed to communicate with sockets (linux) or named pipes (windows) using interprocess communication to determine the state of certain visual components.
                    For example, if a connection is established, a status icon will be toggled green to reflect its state. 
                   <br><br>
                    During my testing with this application, I ran into issues arised from a race condition when refreshing the statuses of multiple networks.
                    I was able to solve this concurrency issue by using locks and some help from a senior developer. 
                    I definitely learned a lot during this internship and would love to give everyone at MenloLab a shoutout for helping me along the way.

                    that each company was currently facing. 
                    12 students are selected every season to form two teams of 6 that will compete throughout the season. The companies that 
                    we had the opportunity of working with in Season 17 were Microsoft, Telus, Canadian Tire, Jan Kelly, and PepsiCo.

                    MARS Apprentice widened my perspective on how businesses work. Having spent so much of my time being on the engineering side, it was very refreshing to tackle
                    problems from a new point of view. All other members on my team except for myself, came from a business background. During case introductions,the initial approach that I had in mind would be completely 
                    different from theirs. After listening to their thoughts, I realized that they had considered other aspects that I had not thought of.

                    <br><br>
                    Through this experience, I learned to see a business problem through multiple different lens. I introduced software and tools that we can leverage to my team, to help our strategy to provide more value to my team.
                    My team showed me how to think like a marketer, how to collect data to derive our insights in order to construct our strategy. By helping each other and receiving feedback from the judges and mentors, our team got better and better after each presentation. 
                    In the end, we were able to become the winners of Season 17 MARS Apprentice!

                    First internship. This was my first experience working at company outside of McMaster. Technical responsiblilities aside, I felt like 
                    I had so many new things to navigate. Learning about company culture, working on teams with people with vastly different experiences and background, 
                    and then the pandemic had hit 
                    
                  <span class="dots">...</span>


                  <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                    in the middle of my internship. I adjusted to working remotely and from home, and having virtual meetings. 
                    This experience definitely helped shaped how I saw an organization and what my role was in it. 

                    <br><br>
                    RBC has many employees. Although every team is technically under RBC, almost every team is different in terms of culture and team synergy. 
                    Different departments had different challenges so everyone's solution was different.
                    During this term, I worked on multiple teams and learning about each team's aspect of work. Through this, I learned that to work effectively on any 
                    team, I must first understand its dynamics and culture. I learned to identify the person that was most likely to have the answer to my question and 
                    reach out to them. The lessons I learned here, I carried them with me to all of my future opportunities.
